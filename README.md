# Baby-Cry-Classifier
A machine learning classifier built in attempt to classify and help me and my wife understand our newborn baby's cries. Includes a dockerfile to build and run an image on an edge device (I use a Raspberry Pi 4 with a USB microphone), as well as a streamlit site for you to view the data and classifications remotely if desired.
